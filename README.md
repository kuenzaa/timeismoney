# Timeismoney

This is a sample project for incorporating Braintree payments to a simple Rails site. The site is simple. After entering payment info, you are charged $0.01 per second you spend visiting the site.

Find a live version of the site [here](http://www.timeismoney.herokuapp.com). Note that my account is in Braintree's test mode, so it won't actually charge you.

And [here](http://www.hereisahand.com/integrating-braintree-with-a-rails-app/) is a blog post with a more detailed description.
